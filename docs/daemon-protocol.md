# `jucode daemon` Protocol

`jucode daemon` hosts many JuCode sessions in one long-running process.
Sessions keep running when every client disconnects. Clients (Desktop, the
remote web page) connect over a WebSocket and speak the `jucode serve`
protocol version 2 (`docs/serve-protocol.md`), with a `session` field that
says which hosted session an op or event belongs to.

Background and roadmap: `docs/agent-daemon-plan.md`.

## Running

```sh
jucode daemon                      # ws://127.0.0.1:7788
jucode daemon --listen 127.0.0.1:9000
```

State lives in `~/.jucode/daemon/`:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `token` | Client token, created on first start, mode 0600. |
| `sessions.jsonl` | Append log of sessions opened and closed. |
| `actions.jsonl` | Append log of deferred actions and their decisions. |

## Connecting

Connect to `ws://<listen>/?token=<token>` (or send
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). A missing or wrong token fails the
handshake with HTTP 401. Local clients read the token from
`~/.jucode/daemon/token`.

Each WebSocket text message is one JSON frame. The daemon first sends:

```json
{"type":"hello","protocol":2,"version":"0.3.0"}
{"type":"sessions","sessions":[{"session":"...","cwd":"...","created_at":0,"open":true,"watchers":0}]}
```

A client that does not speak `protocol` 2 must disconnect.

## Replies

A frame may carry an `id`. Replies to daemon ops go only to the client that
sent the op and echo its `id`. Errors from any op are replied as
`{"type":"error","message":"...","id":...}`. Session events are sent to
every connected client.

## Daemon ops

| Op | Fields | Reply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session_list` | — | `sessions` |
| `session_create` | `cwd` | `session_created` with `session`; the session's startup events follow |
| `session_open` | `session` | `session_opened`; reopens a closed session (or one from before a restart), resuming its transcript and its undecided deferred actions |
| `session_close` | `session` | none; every client receives `session_closed` once the engine has stopped |
| `watch` / `unwatch` | `session` | `watching` with `watching: true/false` |
| `actions_list` | — | `actions`: undecided deferred actions across all sessions |

## Session ops

Every op from `docs/serve-protocol.md` (`user_message`, `command`, `steer`,
`interrupt`, `approve`, `set_approval_mode`, `decide_action`, `mcp_*`) is
accepted with a `session` field and forwarded to that session's engine. Its
events carry the same `session` field.

Differences from `jucode serve`:

- A hosted engine keeps one session for its whole life. `/new` and
  `/resume <id>` are refused; use `session_create` and `session_open`.
  `/quit` closes the session.
- `set_attended` is refused. A session is attended while at least one
  connected client watches it: the first `watch` sets it attended, and the
  last `unwatch` or disconnect sets it unattended, which turns any pending
  `approval_request` into a deferred action.
- `decide_action` is recorded in `actions.jsonl` before the engine acts on
  it, so an approved action is never offered again after a restart.
